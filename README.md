Coil Calculator

This is my first Objective-C app. I went through a number of iterations and even a complete re-write as I learned more of Objective-C. This is the latest version. The app calculates the properties of a wound coil based on values entered by the user. It is meant to be useful for both electro-magnets and inductors alike.
